1.What is CSS?<h4><MARK>
</h4>

<p>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</p>

<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications</p>

<P>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to add styles to the HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the web page. The reason of using CSS is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows web developers to control the visual appearance of web pages.</P>

<p><h4><mark>History of CSS</h4></P>
<P>
1994- CSS was introduced by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie proposed the idea of CSS. 1996- The first version of CSS was invented. 1998- CSS 2 was released and work on CSS 3 began. CSS 3 was very different from the other versions, fot instead of being a single monolithic specification, it was published as a set of separate documents known as modules.</P>
<p>
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, first emerged in the early 1990s as a solution to the growing complexity of web design. The web was in its infancy, and designers were limited in their ability to control the appearance of web pages. Web content was mostly text-based, and HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was the primary tool for structuring web documents.
However, as the demand for more visually appealing websites grew, the need for a dedicated styling language became apparent. This gave birth to the concept of CSS. In 1994, Hakon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer, and Bert Bos, a Dutch programmer, proposed the first CSS specification. Their vision was to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), thus simplifying web development and making it more flexible. The difference between HTML and CSS lies in their roles: HTML structures web content, while CSS styles and formats that content.

<p><h4><mark> Versions of CSS</H4>
<li><P>CSS1 (1996): The first official CSS specification, CSS1, was introduced in 1996. It allowed for basic stylings, such as changing text colors, fonts, and backgrounds, but was limited in terms of layout control.

<li><p>CSS2 (1998): CSS2, released in 1998, introduced a plethora of new features, including positioning, improved control over layout, and the introduction of media types for different devices.<br>

<li><p>CSS2.1 (2011): This version focused on clarifying and improving the CSS2 specification, providing greater stability and browser compatibility.

<li><p>CSS3 (ongoing): CSS3 is not a single monolithic release but a collection of modular specifications introduced gradually. These modules cover various aspects of web design, such as animations, gradients, and flexible box layouts.

<li><p>CSS4 (in development): CSS4 is the future of CSS, aiming to further enhance web design capabilities, including responsive design, variable fonts, and improved grid systems.

<h4> <mark>Browser Support </H4>
<p>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) support in browsers varies depending on the version of the browser and the specific CSS properties being used. Browsers implement CSS based on the specifications set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). When new CSS features are introduced, browser vendors gradually incorporate support for them into their browsers through updates. Developers often use feature detection techniques or CSS vendor prefixes to ensure compatibility across different browsers. Additionally, CSS polyfills and fallbacks can be employed to provide support for older browsers that may not fully support newer CSS features.<br></p>
Some of the points showing how CSS supports browsing were:
<ul>
<li><p>Progressive Enhancement: Start with a solid foundation of basic CSS that works across all browsers, then enhance it with additional styles for modern browsers that support advanced features.

<li><p>Feature Detection: Use JavaScript or CSS techniques to detect browser capabilities and apply appropriate styles or fallbacks accordingly. Modernizr is a popular library for feature detection.

<li><p>Vendor Prefixes: Some CSS properties may require vendor prefixes (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms-, -o-) to work across different browsers. By including these prefixes, you can ensure compatibility with specific browser rendering engines.

<li><p>Polyfills: Polyfills are JavaScript scripts that provide fallback functionality for CSS features not supported in older browsers. They emulate the behavior of newer CSS features to ensure consistent rendering across all browsers.

<li><p>CSS Resets/Normalizations: CSS resets or normalizations help to ensure consistent default styles across different browsers, reducing the likelihood of unexpected rendering differences.

<li><p>Testing: Regularly test your CSS styles across multiple browsers and devices to identify and address any compatibility issues. Browser testing tools like BrowserStack or CrossBrowserTesting can be helpful for this purpose.

<p>By combining these strategies and staying updated on CSS specifications and browser support, developers can achieve broad compatibility with CSS across various browsers.<br>
<p><h4><mark> CSS vs CSS3</h4><br>
<table>
<tr>
<th>CSS </th>
<th>CSS3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>W3C developed the first version of CSS in 1996</td>
<td> CSS3 is the latest version of CSS released in the year 2005</td>
</tr> HTML5 is the next revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is cooperation between the (W3C) World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. It has new features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flash. 
he latest version of almost web browser supports the html5 like Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera etc. Html5 supported by all mobile browser also like android, iPhones, iPads. It has many new features and attributes which is useful in the making of beautiful websites.

<p><h4><mark> Types of CSS</h4> <br>
 The new features that were added in HTML5 that make it better than HTML :<br>

  1. Intro of audio and video:<br> 
 Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.<br>

 2. Vector Graphics:<br>
This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.<br>

3. Header and Footer:<br>
With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a <div> tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using <header> and <footer> HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later.<br> 

<p>The header can contain-<br>
  # One or more heading elements<br>
  # Logo or icon<br>
  # Authorship information<br>
Footer can contain-<br>
  # Authorship information<br> 
  # Copyright information<br>
  # Contact information<br>
  # Back to top links<br>

4. Figure and Figcaption:<br>
  HTML5 allows to use a element to mark up a photo in a document, and a  element to define a caption for the photo. The  tag defines a caption for a  element. This tag provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure. It can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of code, or other content.<br>

5.Nav tag:<br>
 The  tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that links to different pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of approaches. Common examples of the nav elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes. This element makes it much easier to create a navigation menu, creates a neat horizontal menu of text links, and helps screen reading software to correctly identify primary navigation areas in the document.</br>

<p> <h4><mark> BACKWORD COMPATIBILITY </h4> 
Backward compatible (also known as downward compatible or backward compatibility) refers to a hardware or software system that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems.

For example, Perl, the scripting language, was designed to be backward compatible with Awk, an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace.

Another example is the Microsoft Xbox Series X and Series S, as well as the Xbox One X, which are backward compatible with all original Xbox games.

Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible, or extensible, with built-in features such as hooks, plugins, or an application program interface that allows the addition of new features.

It's important to note that the term backward compatible has occasionally been used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions, causing the older version and new version to fight (or combat) each other.

In this case, the two versions cannot share data easily and may have functionality that causes errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer, often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to. Even if the older hardware is removed, the remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version.

An adjacent concept is forward compatibility, which refers to creating software and hardware with a roadmap directed at compatibility with future products.</BR>

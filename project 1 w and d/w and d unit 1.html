<h4><MARK>
HISTORY OF WWW</h4>

<p>
The World Wide Web ("WWW", "W3" or simply "the Web") is a global information medium which users can access via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often mistakenly used as a synonym for the Internet, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as email and Usenet do. The history of the Internet and the history of hypertext date back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web while working at CERN in 1989. He proposed a "universal linked information system" using several concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the connections that existed between information.[1][2] He developed the first web server, the first web browser, and a document formatting protocol, called Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). After publishing the markup language in 1991, and releasing the browser source code for public use in 1993, many other web browsers were soon developed, with Marc Andreessen's Mosaic (later Netscape Navigator), being particularly easy to use and install, and often credited with sparking the Internet boom of the 1990s. It was a graphical browser which ran on several popular office and home computers, bringing multimedia content to non-technical users by including images and text on the same page.</p>

<P>Websites for use by the general public began to emerge in 1993–94. This spurred competition in server and browser software, highlighted in the Browser wars which was initially dominated by Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. Following the complete removal of commercial restrictions on Internet use by 1995, commercialization of the Web amidst macroeconomic factors led to the dot-com boom and bust in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</P>

<P>The features of HTML evolved over time, leading to HTML version 2 in 1995, HTML3 and HTML4 in 1997, and HTML5 in 2014. The language was extended with advanced formatting in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and with programming capability by JavaScript. AJAX programming delivered dynamic content to users, which sparked a new era in Web design, styled Web 2.0. The use of social media, becoming common-place in the 2010s, allowed users to compose multimedia content without programming skills, making the Web ubiquitous in every-day life.</p>

<p><h4><mark>EVOLUTION OF HTML</h4></P>
<P>
HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in a much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.</P>
<UL>
<LI><P> HTML 1.0: was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.</LI>
<LI><P> HTML 2.0: published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.</LI>
<LI><P> HTML 3.0: where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.</LI>
<LI><P> HTML 4.01: which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide.</LI>                                                   <LI> <P>HTML 5: can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012.</LI></P>


<h4><mark> DiFFERENT VERSIONS OF HTML</h4>


<LI><P> HTML 1.0:One of the first versions of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, laying down the foundations for building web pages. Some of its primary characteristics were:<br>

<p>(i)Structuring Elements: HTML 1.0 introduced elements that made it possible to add structure to the content on web pages. These included headings, lists, paragraphs, and images.<br>
<p>(ii)Comparatively Simpler: HTML 1.0 was very simple in comparison to later versions of HTML. It didn’t have styling options or the ability to control how content would display in a web browser. Additionally, HTML 1.0 lacked any support for tables.<br>
<p>(iii)Font Support: Although HTML 1.0 introduced fonts, it was limited. In other words, there was minimal scope for changing the text style or size.<br>
Nonetheless, HTML 1.0 initiated the field of web development, and its features kept advancing with every updated version.<br></p>

<li><p>HTML 2.0:The HTML 2.0 version was released in 1995 and had considerable improvements from the previous version. Some of them were:<br></li>

<p>(i)Standardization of HTML: This version made HTML into a standard by establishing common rules and regulations that all web browsers had to follow.<br>
<p>(ii)Forms: Most importantly, HTML 2.0 introduced the concept of forms, which allowed users to input data on web pages. However, the forms were still basic and only contained text boxes and buttons.<br>
<p>(iii)Tables: HTML 2.0 introduced the &lt;table&gt; tag for creating tabular data on web pages, contributing to better organization of data.<br>
<p>(iv) Formation of the W3C: During HTML 2.0, browsers started making their own tags, because of which there was inconsistency across different browsers. To resolve the issue and establish standardization, the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was formed. This helped web browsers to render tags in a consistent manner.</br> </p>

 <li><p>HTML 3.2:HTML 3.2 was the next major successor to HTML 2.0 and was developed in 1997. The updated features included in it are:<br></li>

<p>(i)Upgraded Form Elements: HTML 3.2 brought better ways to create interactive forms on websites. Developers could make forms that were more interactive and dynamic for users.<br>
<p>(ii)CSS Support: Another important feature included in HTML 3.2 was support for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). It helped designers improve the look of web pages by styling and customizing HTML elements.<br>
<P>(iii)Enhanced Image Features: Handling images became easier with HTML 3.2. It allowed for better control over image size, alignment, and text descriptions.<br>
<p>(iv)Extended Character Set: HTML 3.2 also expanded the available characters for web pages. It included special symbols and international characters for a more diverse presentation of the content.<br></p>
<li><p>HTML 4.01:HTML 4.01, released in 1999, brought several advancements to the HTML language. Here are some of the updated features:<br></li>
<p>(i)CSS Linking: With HTML 4.01,CSS files could be linked and include in each HTML page using the &1t;link&gt; tag .This h(elped maintain consistent styles across web pages without repeating CSS code.<br>
<p>(ii)New tags: also intro new tags.<br>
<p>(iii)Table Enhancement: HTML 4.01 made tables more powerful. We could use attribute like colspan and rowspan . This made it easier to create more complicated and interesting tables.<br>
<li><p> HTML5<br></li>
<p>WHAT released the initial public draft of HTML5 in 2008, but it officially became a W3C recommendation on October 28, 2014. The version brought extensive support for new HTML tags. Furthermore, HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input elements of different types and geolocations support tags, etc.
<p><h4> <mark>WHY HTML 5 </H4></P>
<p>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the standard programming language for creating websites and web applications. The official specification of HTML5 was released in 2014 and has become the most widely used version.<br></p>
<li><p>Some of the key features of HTML5 include the following:<br></li>
<p>(i)Improved semantic elements: HTML5 introduced new semantic features that provide additional meaning to the content on a web page, such as header, footer, nav, article, and section.<br>
<p>(ii)Multimedia support: HTML5 includes built-in audio and video playback support, eliminating the need for plugins such as Flash.<br>
<P>(iii)Canvas element: The canvas element allows developers to create graphics and animations using JavaScript, making it possible to create complex visualizations and interactive games in the browser.<br>
<p>(iv)Improved forms: HTML5 introduced new input types and attributes that make it easier to create forms and validate user input.<br>
  <p>(v)Offline storage: HTML5 provides offline storage APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally and continue functioning even when the user is offline.<br>
 <p>(vi)Improved accessibility: HTML5 provided new attributes and elements that make it easier to create accessible websites and web applications.<br>
<p>HTML5 is designed to be compatible with a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, making it easier for developers to create cross-platform web applications that work seamlessly on multiple devices.<br>
<p><h4><mark> HTML 4 VS HTML 5</h4><br></P>

<p>HTML5 is the next revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is cooperation between the (W3C) World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group. It has new features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe Flash. 
he latest version of almost web browser supports the html5 like Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera etc. Html5 supported by all mobile browser also like android, iPhones, iPads. It has many new features and attributes which is useful in the making of beautiful websites.</p>

<p><h4><mark> HTML 5 NEW FEATURES </h4>
 <p>The new features that were added in HTML5 that make it better than HTML :<br></P>

<p>(i)Intro of audio and video:Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website. HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag. You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations. HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player. This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.<br></P>

<p>(ii)Vector Graphics:This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS. Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation. Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web. That’s the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.<br></P>

<p>(iii)Header and Footer:With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a &lt;div&gt; tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By using &1t;header&gt; and &1t;footer&gt; HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later.<br></P> 

  <p>The header can contain-<br></p>
  <p>(i) One or more heading elements<br>
  <p>(ii)Logo or icon<br>
  <p>(iii)Authorship information<br>
  <p>Footer can contain-<br></P>
  <p>(ii)Authorship information<br> 
  <p>(iii)Copyright information<br>
  <p>(iv)Contact information<br>
  <p>(v)Back to top links<br>

<p>(iii)Figure and Figcaption:HTML5 allows to use a element to mark up a photo in a document, and a  element to define a caption for the photo. The  tag defines a caption for a  element. This tag provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure. It can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of code, or other content.<br></P>

<p>(iv)Nav tag:The  tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that links to different pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of approaches. Common examples of the nav elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes. This element makes it much easier to create a navigation menu, creates a neat horizontal menu of text links, and helps screen reading software to correctly identify primary navigation areas in the document.</br></p>

<p> <h4><mark> BACKWORD COMPATIBILITY </h4> </p>
<p>Backward compatible (also known as downward compatible or backward compatibility) refers to a hardware or software system that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems.</p>

<p>For example, Perl, the scripting language, was designed to be backward compatible with Awk, an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace.</p>

<p>Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible, or extensible, with built-in features such as hooks, plugins, or an application program interface that allows the addition of new features.</p>

<p>It's important to note that the term backward compatible has occasionally been used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions, causing the older version and new version to fight (or combat) each other.</P>

<p>In this case, the two versions cannot share data easily and may have functionality that causes errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer, often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to. Even if the older hardware is removed, the remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version.</P>

<br>An adjacent concept is forward compatibility, which refers to creating software and hardware with a roadmap directed at compatibility with future products.</BR>
